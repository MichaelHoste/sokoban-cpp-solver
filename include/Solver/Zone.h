/**
 * @brief Binary representation of positions in a level.
 *
 * Can be used to represent boxes zone, pusher move zone, deadlocks zone or
 * goals zone.
 *
 * Zone is stocked in a unsigned integer tab (unsigned int = 2 or 4 bits
 * depending of the CPU). Each "usefull" cell of the level
 * (see zoneToLevelPos from solver) corresponds to 1 bit. If this bit is "1"
 * then there is a "box/possible move/deadlock/goal" on this position
 * depending of the wanted action.
 *
 * Boxes zone representation : 1 if there is a box in this zone position, 0 if
 * not
 * Goals zone representation : 1 if there is a goal in this zone position, 0 if
 * not
 * Deadlock zone representation : 1 if there is a deadlock when a box is in this
 * zone position, 0 if not
 * Pusher move zone representation : 1 if pusher can move on this position OR
 * if this is a box position just next a place where pusher can move, 0 if not
 *
